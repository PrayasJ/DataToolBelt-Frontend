DataToolBelt Frontend
=====================

This is the frontend of DataToolBelt, a web application that provides a suite of tools for data processing and analysis. This frontend is built with React, Redux, and Material UI.

Getting Started
---------------

To use the DataToolBelt frontend, you will need to run the backend server as well. Follow the instructions in the [DataToolBelt Backend repository](https://github.com/PrayasJ/DataToolBelt-Backend) to get started with the backend.

Once you have the backend server running, follow these steps to run the frontend:

1.  Clone the repository:
    
    `git clone https://github.com/PrayasJ/DataToolBelt-Frontend.git`
    
2.  Install the dependencies:
    
    `cd DataToolBelt-Frontend npm install`
    
3.  Start the development server:
    
    `npm start`
    
    This will start the development server at `http://localhost:3000`. The server will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.
